Spellchecking (Edit → Spellcheck Language) covers English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, Polish, Brazilian Portuguese, Romanian, Russian and Hungarian. The engine is Hunspell itself, compiled to WebAssembly, so every dictionary loads in well under a second. Italian is left out because the only Hunspell dictionary on npm is GPL-3.0-only, which does not sit well in an MIT app. The Brazilian Portuguese interface starts with the Brazilian dictionary; the European Portuguese interface leaves the choice to the writer, since spellings differ.

Spellcheck starts off on every launch. Choosing a dictionary does not turn it on. If the interface starts in Romanian and the library has no saved spellcheck language, NEO selects and saves Romanian. Explicit dictionary choices survive interface-language changes. Other interface languages keep their existing defaults.

Romanian lookup accepts standard diacritics, legacy `ş/ţ`, and decomposed Unicode accents without changing manuscript text. Suggestions use standard Romanian spelling. This checks spelling, not grammar: both `sa` and `să` are words. See [the Romanian evaluation](scripts/romanian-spellcheck.md) and [the Portuguese evaluation](scripts/portuguese-spellcheck.md) for performance and licensing details.

The Hungarian dictionary is LibreOffice's Magyar Ispell 1.9, kept in `dictionaries/hu` (the npm `dictionary-hu` package rejected common accusatives like *könyvet*). They are underlined in blue; right-click shows the fix and why. Each rule is a plain pattern run on the writer's computer, and fires only where a mistake is very likely.

If you speak one of these and something reads oddly, a pull request that fixes a line is the most welcome contribution there is.

NEO's interface can be shown in any language. Each language is a single file in `locales/`, and adding one needs no programming.

## Add a language

1. Copy `locales/_template.json` to `locales/<code>.json`, where `<code>` is the language's code: `de` for German, `es` for Spanish, `pt-BR` for Brazilian Portuguese.
2. Set `_meta.name` to the language's own name (`Deutsch`, `Español`). That is what the **View → Language** menu shows.
3. Fill in each empty value with the translation of its English key. Anything left empty simply stays in English, so a partial translation is fine to start with.
4. Check your work: `node scripts/i18n.js check <code>`. It lists what is missing, and any `{placeholder}` that went astray.

The new language appears in **View → Language** the next time NEO starts.

## Regional variants

Language codes follow [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47): a language (`fr`), optionally followed by a region (`fr-CA`, `fr-BE`, `fr-CH`). NEO also accepts the POSIX spelling (`fr_CA`) when reading a system or saved setting.

A language's base file (`fr.json`) serves every region. A regional file (`fr-CA.json`) holds **only the strings that differ** there, and everything else comes from the base file, then from English:

```
fr-CA.json  →  fr.json  →  English
```

So `fr-CA.json` is short: in Quebec, "courriel" instead of "e-mail", and no space before `; ! ?`. A system set to Belgian or Swiss French, with no `fr-BE.json` or `fr-CH.json`, simply uses `fr.json`. Add a regional file only when wording really differs; numbers and dates already follow the region through the system's own formats.

`node scripts/i18n.js check fr-CA` counts the base file's strings as covered.

## The rules of the file

- **Placeholders** in braces, like `{title}` or `{n}`, are filled in by NEO. Keep them, spelled exactly the same; you can move them anywhere in the sentence.
- **Plurals.** When a string counts something with `{n}`, you can give one form per plural category instead of a single string:

  ```json
  "{n} words": { "one": "{n} mot", "other": "{n} mots" }
  ```

  The categories are those of your language in [Unicode's plural rules](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html) (`one`, `few`, `many`, `other`…). `other` is always required.
- **Numbers** are formatted for the language automatically (`1,234` in English, `1 234` in French).
- **`&amp;`** appears in a few help strings that are shown as HTML. Keep it as `&amp;` (or rephrase without an ampersand).
- **Keyboard keys** such as `⌘`, `⇧` or `Ctrl` are added by NEO; translate the words around them.

## Typing in each language

While writing, NEO sets the quotation marks of the language being written: the spellcheck language when one is chosen, otherwise NEO's own language. « » for French (with narrow no-break spaces), Spanish, Italian, European Portuguese and Russian; „ “ for German; „ ” for Polish, Romanian and Hungarian; “ ” for English, Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese. The apostrophe is always ’. French also gets a narrow no-break space before ; : ! ? (before : only in Canadian French). The table is `QUOTE_STYLES` in `app.js`.

A book that has settled on other guillemets keeps them: in a German novel set in »…«, or Swiss writing in «…», type the first mark by hand and NEO carries on in that style (`bookQuotes` in `app.js`).

Imports recognize chapter headings in all these languages (`CHAPTER_WORDS` in `main.js`), and cover titles treat each language's small words like "of" and "the" (`CONNECTORS` in `covers.js`).

## Fonts in other alphabets

Most fonts NEO bundles (the body fonts on Linux, the drop caps and the cover titles, in `fonts/`) have Latin letters only. For Russian, each has a companion under the same font name in `styles.css` that supplies the Cyrillic letters, so Latin text looks exactly as before. A language with letters of its own needs the same check: every bundled font, companions included, must carry them.

## For developers

The English text is the key. In the window (`app.js`) and the main process (`main.js`), wrap every string a writer can see:

```js
toast(t('Chapter removed — its words are in Darlings, or {key} to undo', { key: KZ }));
```

- `t()` translates now. `tk()` only marks a string for translation where it is defined, for strings translated later with `t()` when shown.
- In `index.html`, mark text with `data-i18n`, and attributes with `data-i18n-title`, `data-i18n-placeholder` or `data-i18n-ph`.
- English plural forms live in `locales/en.json`.
- After adding or changing strings, run `node scripts/i18n.js template` to refresh `locales/_template.json`, and `node scripts/i18n.js check fr` (for each language) to see what needs translating.

The window receives its language once, before any of its code runs (see `preload.js`); changing the language saves the open book and reloads the window.
